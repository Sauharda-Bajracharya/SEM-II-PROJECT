            <span class="c-mass-title">Center of Mass:</span>
            <p class="para-c"> The center of mass in a car is a critical concept in vehicle dynamics and design. It refers to the point within the car where the entire weight or mass of the vehicle can be considered to be concentrated or balanced. It depends on the following factors:<br><br>
                i) <span class="bld">Location</span>- The center of the mass should be located somewhere around the middle of the car.<br>
                ii) <span class="bld">Stability</span>- A lower center of mass is crucial, as it determines more stability.<br>
                iii) <span class="bld">Handling</span>- A well distributed center of mass results in more responsive steering, braking, and acceleration.

            <span class="weight-d-title">Weight Distribution:</span>
            <p class="para-d"> Weight distribution is the distribution of weight inside a vehicle, especially cars, airplanes, and trains. Generally, it is written as x/y, where x is a percentage of front weight  and y is a percentage of rear weight. 
                In a gravity-dependent vehicle, weight distribution directly affects various vehicle characteristics, including handling, acceleration, and traction. For this reason, the weight distribution varies according to the intended use of the vehicle.</p>
