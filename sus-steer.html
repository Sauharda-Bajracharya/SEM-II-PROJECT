            <p class="con">The study of how vehicles handle different road conditions and maintain control. Suspension is responsible for managing the interaction between the wheels and the road/any surface. It provides a comfortable riding experience, maintains traction, and handling and stability of the vehicle. Steering is responsible for controlling the direction of the vehicle's wheels. It provides control of the vehicle and a safe riding experience.</p>

        <div class="ack-geom">
            <p class="para">Ackermann steering geometry is a design principle used in the front-wheel steering systems of vehicles, like cars, to help them turn smoothly and efficiently. It was invented by German engineer, Georg L. Ackermann in 1816 A.D.<br> <br>

                Ackermann steering geometry is all about making sure that when a vehicle turns, the inside wheel and the outside wheel follow different paths. This is important because the wheels need to cover different distances during a turn, with the inside wheel traveling a shorter distance than the outside wheel.<br> <br>
                
                Imagine you're driving a car and you want to make a sharp left turn. Ackermann steering ensures that the inside wheel turns at a sharper angle than the outside wheel. This helps both wheels cover the right distances and prevents them from sliding during the turn. When the wheels are aligned correctly with Ackermann steering, it makes turning smoother and reduces tire wear.</p>
